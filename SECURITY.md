# Security and Responsible Use

This document outlines how the Ethical Prompt Layer (EPL) should be used,
reviewed, and discussed in relation to safety, misuse, and responsible deployment.

EPL is a governance framework, not a security product.

---

## Scope

This document covers:
- responsible implementation
- misuse prevention
- reporting concerns
- safe discussion of vulnerabilities

It does not replace organisational security policies.

---

## Responsible Use

Users and implementers of EPL are expected to:

- apply the framework as designed
- preserve non-coercion and dignity principles
- avoid misuse or intentional harm
- consider real-world impact of deployments

EPL should not be used to justify harmful outcomes.

---

## Prohibited Security Contexts

EPL must not be used to:
- design or justify surveillance systems
- enable biometric identification or tracking
- conceal harmful behaviour
- bypass safety or accountability mechanisms
- normalise coercive or exploitative practices

These restrictions apply regardless of implementation method.

---

## Reporting Concerns

If you identify:
- misuse of EPL
- alignment drift
- harmful deployment patterns
- unintended consequences

You are encouraged to raise concerns responsibly.

Where possible:
- provide clear description
- include context
- avoid public escalation unless necessary

---

## Vulnerability Disclosure

EPL is not software in the traditional sense, but:

- conceptual vulnerabilities
- misuse patterns
- governance failures

should be treated seriously.

Do not publish detailed exploit paths that could enable harm.

---

## No Security Guarantees

EPL does not:
- guarantee safety
- prevent all misuse
- replace human oversight
- act as a security control system

Security remains a shared responsibility.

---

## Design Outcome

This document exists to:
- support responsible discussion
- discourage misuse
- maintain trust
- encourage ethical deployment without secrecy
