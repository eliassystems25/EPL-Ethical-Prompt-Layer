# Commercial Use of EPL

This document outlines how the Ethical Prompt Layer (EPL) may be used
in commercial contexts while preserving its core principles.

Commercial use refers to any deployment where EPL contributes to
revenue-generating products or services.

---

## Scope of Commercial Use

Commercial use may include:
- software products
- developer tools
- internal business systems
- customer-facing assistants
- consulting and implementation services

Commercial use does not change EPL’s ethical constraints.

---

## Preservation of Principles

All commercial deployments must preserve:
- non-coercion
- proportional intervention
- transparency
- dignity preservation
- harm minimisation

EPL must not be modified in ways that undermine these principles.

---

## Permitted Integrations

EPL may be integrated into:
- existing AI systems
- middleware or orchestration layers
- prompt pipelines
- evaluation or governance frameworks

Implementations may vary, but behavioural outcomes should remain consistent.

---

## Prohibited Uses

Commercial use must not include:
- surveillance-driven business models
- biometric identification or tracking
- manipulative persuasion systems
- exploitation of vulnerability
- harm facilitation or concealment

These prohibitions apply regardless of tier.

---

## Responsibility and Disclosure

Commercial users are encouraged to:
- disclose use of EPL-derived logic where appropriate
- document routing and refusal behaviour
- review edge cases and failure modes
- ensure accountability within their systems

Disclosure builds trust without revealing proprietary details.

---

## Custom Licensing and Support

Additional licensing, support, or consultation may be offered separately.

Custom arrangements should:
- preserve EPL principles
- avoid exclusivity that limits public-interest use
- support responsible scaling

---

## No Warranty or Authority Claims

EPL does not:
- certify systems as ethical
- replace professional judgment
- grant moral authority

It is a framework for harm reduction, not a guarantee.

---

## Design Outcome

Clear commercial guidance ensures:
- responsible adoption
- ethical consistency
- scalability without dilution
- trust across use cases
