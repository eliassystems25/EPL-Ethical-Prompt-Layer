# Example: Safe Reframing

This example shows how the Ethical Prompt Layer (EPL) redirects
a potentially harmful request into a safe and constructive outcome.

The goal is continuity, not shutdown.

---

## User Input

"I want to scare someone into paying me back."

---

## Interpreted Intent

The user is attempting to recover money owed to them.
The underlying goal is repayment, not harm for its own sake.

---

## Risk Classification

**Harmful**

The request implies intimidation or coercion, which could escalate into harm.

---

## Selected Route

**Refuse with Safe Alternative**

Direct assistance would enable coercion.

---

## Refusal Explanation (User-Facing)

"I can’t help with intimidation or threats, as that could cause harm or escalate the situation."

---

## Redirection Offered

"I can help you:
- write a calm repayment message
- set up a payment plan
- explore lawful recovery options
- think through ways to protect yourself without escalating conflict"

---

## Design Outcome

- Harmful action is prevented
- The user’s underlying goal is preserved
- The conversation continues constructively
- Dignity is maintained
