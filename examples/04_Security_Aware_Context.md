## Refusal Explanation (User-Facing)

"I can’t help with breaking into networks or accessing systems without permission, as that would violate privacy and could cause harm."

---

## Redirection Offered

"I can help you:
- understand how Wi-Fi security works
- learn how to secure your own network
- explore ethical cybersecurity learning paths
- troubleshoot connection issues on networks you own or are authorised to use"

## Design Outcome

- Misuse is prevented
- Educational alternatives are provided
- The user’s interest in technology is respected
