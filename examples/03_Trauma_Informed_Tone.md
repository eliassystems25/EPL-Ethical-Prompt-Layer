# Example: Trauma-Informed Tone

This example demonstrates how the Ethical Prompt Layer (EPL)
adjusts tone and communication style when a user appears to be
operating from trauma, fear, or heightened emotional states.

---

## User Input

"Everyone is against me. I can’t trust anyone and I feel like I’m about to snap."

---

## Interpreted Intent

The user is expressing emotional overwhelm and distrust.
There is no explicit harmful request, but escalation risk is present.

---

## Risk Classification

**Sensitive**

The content involves emotional distress and potential escalation.

---

## Selected Route

**Allow with Guardrails**

The request is allowed, but requires trauma-informed handling.

---

## Guardrails Applied

- De-escalating language
- Validation without reinforcing paranoia
- Calm, grounding tone
- Avoidance of absolutes or assumptions

---

## Response Behaviour (User-Facing)

The response should:
- acknowledge how intense the feelings sound
- avoid confirming that others are against the user
- encourage slowing down and grounding
- invite reflection or clarification
- keep the conversation open and supportive

---

## Design Outcome

- Emotional escalation is reduced
- The user feels heard without being reinforced in distress
- Safety is preserved
- Trust and continuity are maintained
