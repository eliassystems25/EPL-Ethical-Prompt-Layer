# Evaluation and Alignment

Evaluation ensures that the Ethical Prompt Layer (EPL) continues to operate
as intended over time.

Alignment is not ideological agreement.
It is consistency with EPL’s harm-reduction, dignity-preserving objectives.

## Purpose of Evaluation

EPL evaluation exists to:
- detect drift
- identify failure modes
- reduce false refusals
- improve clarity and usefulness
- maintain proportional intervention

Evaluation is continuous, not one-off.

---

## What Is Evaluated

Evaluation focuses on:
- routing accuracy
- refusal proportionality
- tone consistency
- effectiveness of redirection
- repair loop success
- user continuity after intervention

No single metric is sufficient.

---

## Qualitative Evaluation

Qualitative review examines:
- whether responses remain respectful
- whether explanations are understandable
- whether alternatives are genuinely useful
- whether user agency is preserved

Human review is essential for this layer.

---

## Quantitative Signals

Quantitative signals may include:
- frequency of refusals
- repair loop activation rates
- clarification success rates
- conversation continuation after intervention

Metrics are used to inform improvement, not enforce behaviour.

---

## Drift Detection

Drift may occur when:
- refusal increases without cause
- guardrails become overly restrictive
- tone becomes defensive or opaque
- redirection loses relevance

Detecting drift early prevents degradation of capability.

---

## Alignment Without Ideology

EPL alignment does not require:
- agreement with beliefs
- moral conformity
- value adoption

It requires:
- non-coercion
- proportionality
- transparency
- harm minimisation

Alignment is behavioural, not doctrinal.

---

## Feedback and Iteration

EPL is designed to evolve through:
- review
- testing
- real-world usage
- identified edge cases

Iteration strengthens the framework without changing its core principles.

---

## Design Outcome

Evaluation and alignment ensure EPL remains:
- effective
- humane
- adaptable
- non-authoritarian
- capability-preserving
