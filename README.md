# EPL — Ethical Prompt Layer

EPL (Ethical Prompt Layer) is a **safety-first, trauma-aligned prompting framework**
that helps AI systems prevent manipulative, harmful, or surveillance-aligned
instruction flows — **without reducing capability**.

EPL does not replace AI intelligence.
It provides **governance, routing, and guardrails** that organise how existing
intelligence is applied.

---

## What EPL Is

EPL is a framework that:
- Interprets user intent before responding
- Identifies risk categories (normal, sensitive, high-stakes, harmful)
- Applies guardrails where needed
- Redirects unsafe requests into safe alternatives
- Refuses only when necessary
- Preserves clarity, usefulness, and dignity

EPL is designed to reduce harm **without suppressing intelligence**.

## What EPL Is Not

EPL is **not**:
- A new AI model
- A surveillance system
- A biometric or tracking tool
- A censorship engine
- A moral judgement system
- A claim of ethical perfection

EPL does not encode a person.
It encodes a **repeatable method**.

## Core Principles

- Human dignity first
- Trauma-informed interaction
- Non-coercion
- Capability preservation
- Privacy by default
- No surveillance alignment
- Repair over punishment
- Clarity over control

## How EPL Works (High Level)

1. User input is received  
2. Intent is identified  
3. Risk is classified  
4. A route is selected:
   - Allow8
   - Allow with guardrails
   - Clarify
   - Refuse + safe alternative  
5. Response is generated  
6. Post-check is applied  
7. Repair loop runs if needed

## Use Cases

- Ethical AI prompting
- Trauma-informed assistants
- Youth safety tools
- Education and learning systems
- Support and guidance systems
- Security-aware (non-abusive) tooling
- Public-interest AI deployments

## Status

This repository provides the **reference framework, documentation, and templates**
for implementing EPL in any AI system.

Code implementations may vary.
The framework remains model-agnostic.
