EPL™ — Ethical Prompt Layer
Public Governance Specification
EPL™ (Ethical Prompt Layer) is a structured governance routing framework designed to organise how AI systems interpret, classify, and respond to user inputs within regulated and high-trust environments.
It provides a safety-first decision-routing layer that reduces manipulative, harmful, or unstable instruction flows — without diminishing underlying model capability.
EPL does not replace AI intelligence.
It structures how intelligence is applied.
Scope
Governance routing
Intent classification
Behavioural risk categorisation
Guardrail application logic
Structured refusal & redirection protocols
Post-response stability validation
EPL is model-agnostic and may be integrated into any AI-supported decision environment.
What EPL Provides
EPL introduces a repeatable governance method that:
Interprets user intent before response execution
Classifies behavioural risk (normal, sensitive, high-stakes, harmful)
Applies structured guardrails proportionate to risk
Redirects unsafe instructions into safe alternatives
Limits refusals to necessary conditions
Preserves clarity, usefulness, and user dignity
Enables post-response stability checks
Supports repair-loop reprocessing where needed
EPL is designed to reduce harm without suppressing intelligence or degrading capability.
Governance Positioning
EPL functions as:
A behavioural routing layer
An interpretive governance protocol
A guardrail enforcement structure
A decision-path stabilisation mechanism
It is not a model, filter, or surveillance tool.
What EPL Is Not
EPL is not:
A standalone AI model
A surveillance architecture
A biometric or tracking system
A censorship engine
A moral enforcement mechanism
A claim of ethical perfection
EPL encodes a repeatable governance method, not a person, belief system, or ideology.
Core Design Principles
Human dignity prioritisation
Trauma-informed interaction logic
Non-coercive response structures
Capability preservation
Privacy by default
No surveillance alignment
Repair over punishment
Clarity over control
High-Level Processing Flow
Input received
Intent classification
Risk categorisation
Routing selection:
Allow
Allow with guardrails
Clarify
Refuse + safe alternative
Response generation
Post-response validation
Repair-loop activation (if instability detected)
Example Governance Use Cases
AI governance diagnostics
Trauma-informed assistant systems
Youth safety environments
Educational AI deployment
Security-aware (non-abusive) interaction routing
Public-interest AI infrastructure
Relationship to Elias Systems Governance Stack
EPL operates alongside:
EBOS™ — Behavioural modelling architecture
Love Formula™ — Relational integrity modelling
97/3 Immutable Core — Structural stability framework
Together, these form a layered governance stack for AI-supported decision ecosystems.
