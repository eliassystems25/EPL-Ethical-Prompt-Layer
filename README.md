# EPL™ — Ethical Prompt Layer  
Public Governance Specification

## Overview
EPL™ (Ethical Prompt Layer) is a structured governance routing framework designed to organise how AI systems interpret, classify, and respond to user inputs within regulated and high-trust environments.

It introduces a safety-first decision-routing layer that reduces manipulative, harmful, or unstable instruction flows — without diminishing underlying model capability.

EPL does not replace AI intelligence. It structures how intelligence is applied.

## Governance Function
EPL functions as a behavioural governance routing layer.

It provides:
- Intent classification prior to response execution
- Behavioural risk categorisation (normal, sensitive, high-stakes, harmful)
- Structured guardrail application
- Refusal and redirection protocols
- Post-response stability validation

EPL is model-agnostic and may be integrated into any AI-supported decision environment.

## What EPL Provides
EPL introduces a repeatable governance method that:

- Interprets user intent before response execution
- Classifies behavioural risk categories
- Applies structured guardrails proportionate to risk
- Redirects unsafe instructions into safe alternatives
- Limits refusals to necessary conditions
- Preserves clarity, usefulness, and user dignity
- Enables post-response stability checks
- Supports repair-loop reprocessing where required

EPL is designed to reduce harm without suppressing intelligence or degrading capability.

## What EPL Is Not
EPL is not:

- A standalone AI model
- A surveillance architecture
- A biometric or tracking system
- A censorship engine
- A moral enforcement mechanism
- A claim of ethical perfection

EPL encodes a repeatable governance method — not a person, ideology, or belief system.

## Core Design Principles
- Human dignity prioritisation
- Trauma-informed interaction logic
- Non-coercive response structures
- Capability preservation
- Privacy by default
- No surveillance alignment
- Repair over punishment
- Clarity over control

## High-Level Processing Flow
1. User input received  
2. Intent identified  
3. Risk classified  
4. Route selected:
   - Allow
   - Allow with guardrails
   - Clarify
   - Refuse + safe alternative  
5. Response generated  
6. Post-response validation  
7. Repair loop activation (if instability detected)
8. 
9. 
## Governance Positioning
EPL operates as:

- A behavioural routing layer
- An interpretive governance protocol
- A guardrail enforcement structure
- A decision-path stabilisation mechanism

It is not a model, filter, or surveillance tool.

## Relationship to Governance Stack
Within the Elias Systems governance architecture, EPL operates alongside:

- EBOS™ — Behavioural modelling architecture
- Love Formula™ — Relational integrity modelling
- 97/3 Immutable Core — Structural stability framework

Together, these components form a layered governance stack for AI-supported decision ecosystems.

## Repository Scope
This repository provides:

- Governance routing specifications
- Reference documentation
- Example templates
- Integration logic notes

Implementation details may vary by deployment environment.

## Licensing
This framework is released under a structured ethical license.

Commercial licensing is available via Elias Systems Ltd.
