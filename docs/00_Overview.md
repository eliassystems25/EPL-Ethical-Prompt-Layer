# EPL Overview

EPL (Ethical Prompt Layer) is a structured framework designed to ensure AI outputs remain:
- non-coercive
- non-exploitative
- privacy-respecting
- trauma-informed
- capability-preserving

EPL does not introduce new intelligence.
It organises how existing intelligence is applied in real-world contexts.

## Purpose

The purpose of EPL is simple:

- Reduce harm
- Preserve usefulness
- Prevent misuse
- Maintain human dignity

EPL achieves this through:
- intent interpretation
- risk classification
- routing logic
- guardrails
- refusal only when necessary
- repair loops instead of punishment

---

## Design Philosophy

EPL is built on the principle that:

> Safety should not reduce intelligence —  
> it should redirect intelligence toward outcomes that do not cause harm.

This framework is model-agnostic and can be applied to any AI system.
